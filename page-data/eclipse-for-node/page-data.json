One very common IDE for webworkers is Web-/PhpStrom from <a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/\">JetBrains</a>. They have some great and handy tools, like node.js integration.</p>\n<p>Well, I’m used to <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php\">Eclipse</a> for years and since i’m eager to work on some node.js projects in my sparetime i had to set it up for node.js development.</p>\n<p>My recommendation so far is: Use <a href=\"http://www.nodeclipse.org/\">nodeclipse</a>.</p>\n<p>Howto install:</p>\n<p>It’s probably best to use the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunar\">Eclipse Java EE</a> version of eclipse, since it has elementary plugins like git support preinstalled. After starting Eclipse (you need a Java RE), just goto Help-Install New Software and add the nodeclipse update site <a href=\"http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/\">http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/</a> . There should be the .<em>Features Set</em> group with a <em>Features included in Enide Studio</em> option. Use that and feel free to check everything else you consider useful. I like the <em>StartExplorer Feature</em> addon, which allows you to easily open your shell in the current path, very useful if you consider using grunt, which you should.</p>\n<p>This setup allows you to create node.js project with New-Project-Nodeclipse-Node.js Project, as well as debugging of your node.js server component.</p>\n<p><sub><sup>Side: This article was originally published at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kriswep/setting-up-eclipse-ide-for-node-js-development-aa6cea19f94\">Medium</a>.</sup></sub></p>","fields":{"slug":"/articles/2014-09-Eclipse-Node/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 19, 2014","path":"/eclipse-for-node/","title":"Setting up Eclipse IDE for node.js development","description":"How I set up the Eclipse IDE for node.js development","author":"@kriswep","layout":"post","readNext":"/articles/2017-02-Testing-indexjs/","issueNumber":7}},"readNext":{"frontmatter":{"date":"February 19, 2017","path":"/testing-indexjs/","title":"Unit testing a React index.js file","description":"Writing unit tests for your React index.js file can be a little tricky.
