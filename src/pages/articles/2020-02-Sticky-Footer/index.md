### Make your footer stick to the bottom with flexbox

**Having a footer at the bottom of your HTML page can be quite useful. Traditionally, forcing the footer down there was a quite hard task, if the page content didn't fill the whole browser height. But nowadays using flexbox and some auto-margin can save the day.**

  style="width:100%; height:400px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
></iframe>
