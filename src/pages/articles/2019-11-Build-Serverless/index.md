#### Building and transpiling serverless functions Netlify

**Tl,dr: Serverless functions allow you to implement your backend business logic without maintaining server infrastructure. [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) are a great way to get started, allowing you to author your functions in modern JavaScript or TypeScript and transpiling them to the needed format. You can even run your functions locally in your development environment using [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/)**
