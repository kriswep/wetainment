      <h4>Google Analytics with anonymized IP (Google Inc.)</h4>
      <p>
        Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.
        (“Google”). Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine the
        use of wetainment, to prepare reports on its activities. Therefore,
        Google Analytics uses cookies and similiar techniques. Google may use
        the Data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
        advertising network and share them with other Google services.
      </p>
      <p>
        This integration of Google Analytics anonymizes your IP address. It
        works by shortening Users&apos; IP addresses within member states of the
        European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the
        European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP
        address be sent to a Google server and shortened within the US.
