It’s value proposition is that it provides a lot of different utility CSS classes, instead of whole components. So designing an app means, you add CSS classes right to your html elements. These classes are highly composable and allow you to build components and full fledged designs with them. You can find more informations and explanations on their website, or by listening to the <a href=\"http://www.fullstackradio.com/76\">Fullstack Radio podcast 76</a>, which I enjoyed quite a lot.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Wind turbines and a highway, giving you an impression of speed and wind\"\n        title=\"Wind turbines and a highway, giving you an impression of speed and wind\"\n        src=\"/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/1c72d/wind-teaser-image.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/a80bd/wind-teaser-image.jpg 148w,\n/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/1c91a/wind-teaser-image.jpg 295w,\n/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/1c72d/wind-teaser-image.jpg 590w,\n/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/a8a14/wind-teaser-image.jpg 885w,\n/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/fbd2c/wind-teaser-image.jpg 1180w,\n/static/ef573df504458cbcf2a0122644576751/86d28/wind-teaser-image.jpg 2896w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>\n<sub><sup>Kind of related image showing wind turbines and a highway as a metaphor for speed and wind.

It could be a great setup for any desdevs (like devop, but for designer and developer). Whenever I start tinkering with a React App, I reach for <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\">Create React App (CRA)</a>. That’s basically a CLI, which creates a React environment with no build configuration.</p>\n<p>Ok, what would installing Tailwind mean then? So according to their <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/#3-process-your-css-with-tailwind\">documentation</a> there are several ways of doing so. One is to add a css file from a CDN into your html. That works in our CRA setup, but you loose the nice customization options Tailwind offers.</p>\n<p>Their recommended options is to add Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin to your build chain. Although that’s surely a great option for many environments, it’s not that easy in a Create React App project. CRAs key benefit is, that they do all the configuration behind the scenes - that’s great. You could eject from CRA and customize PostCSS for yourself. But that would mean, loosing the easy upgrade path of CRA. Honestly, I suggest not ejecting from CRA, unless you <strong>really</strong> can’t avoid it. There seems to be a way of adding PostCSS plugins via a wrapper as described <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2032#issuecomment-302932310\">here</a>, but that is not officially supported. I did not want to take that path.</p>\n<p>Luckily, another installation option is a CLI-interface. Adding that to your npm scripts allows you to customize the CSS Framework, and also benefit from CRA’s start and build scripts.</p>\n<p>You can find a newly created CRA project with Tailwind CSS integration right <a href=\"https://github.com/kriswep/cra-tailwindcss\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Step by step setup</h4>\n<p>Let’s start with a new Create-React-App project by executing the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Replace cra-tailwindcss with whatever you want to name your project</span>\nnpx create-react-app cra-tailwindcss\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Wait for it to finish</span>\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> cra-tailwindcss</code></pre></div>\n<p>In the generated folder is your brand new React App project, feel free to try it out by running <code class=\"language-text\">npm run start</code>.\nNext step is installing Tailwind CSS by running the following commands in your project’s root directory:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># install tailwind to your project</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> tailwindcss --save-dev\n<span class=\"token comment\"># optionally create a tailwind configuration file</span>\nnpx tailwind init</code></pre></div>\n<p>The last command generates a basic Tailwind configuration file. Since version 1 of Tailwind, this file is optioinal, meaning you only need it if you want to change Tailwinds standard configuration. Read more about the <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration\">configration options</a> in Tailwinds’ documentation.</p>\n<p>Create React App includes a global css file under <code class=\"language-text\">./src/index.css</code>. Delete this file, as this is where we let Tailwind CSS generate it’s utility classes to. Now create a new file called <code class=\"language-text\">./src/index.tailwind.css</code> with the following content:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\"><pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@tailwind</span> base<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@tailwind</span> components<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@tailwind</span> utilities<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>These are Tailwind’s directives, which declare what to include. Again, there is more information in their <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#2-add-tailwind-to-your-css\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>The last step is to add the Tailwind build command to our tooling scripts. Open your projects’ <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> and add the following prebuild and prestart tasks:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\">  <span class=\"token property\">\"scripts\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"prestart\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"tailwind build ./src/index.tailwind.css -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./src/index.css\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"react-scripts start\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"prebuild\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"tailwind build ./src/index.tailwind.css -c ./tailwind.config.js -o ./src/index.css\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"build\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"react-scripts build\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"test\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"eject\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"react-scripts eject\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Fell free to omit the <code class=\"language-text\">-c ./tailwind.config.js</code> option if you don’t need use a configuration file.</p>\n<p>One <code class=\"language-text\">npm run start</code> and we are ready to use the Tailwind CSS utility classes in all our react components.</p>\n<h4>Closing thoughts</h4>\n<p>The above suggested setup runs the Tailwind command only when running the start command, not on every file changes. The react-scripts however still runs on change, which allows you to add classes to your components and see the outcome immediately.</p>\n<p>Not regenereting the CSS all the time is actually not that big of a problem. Remember, using Tailwind CSS means for the most part, you actually don’t write css, you only add CSS classes to elements.</p>\n<p>You could also take that a step further and use Tailwinds’ <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives\">functions and directives</a> in CSS. That would require you running the Tailwind CLI on different CSS files as needed. You could write a shell script to accomplish that. But, for the beginning, the setup described above should be sufficient.</p>\n<p>I hope, this allows you to try using Tailwind CSS and see how it works for you.
