Ended with an aproach to render the same React components on native and on web. Call it React Universal Components.</strong></p>\n<p>Time for an update: Took some time off of my <a href=\"https://github.com/kriswep/morphlog\">morphlog</a> project, will come back to that. Instead, I played with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a>. After seeing a great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1NkyO-J6B0\">React Europe talk</a> regarding rendering React components to native, web and other React targets, my interest was sparked.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Many puzzle pieces from above.\"\n        title=\"Many puzzle pieces from above.\"\n        src=\"/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/1c72d/puzzle.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/a80bd/puzzle.jpg 148w,\n/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/1c91a/puzzle.jpg 295w,\n/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/1c72d/puzzle.jpg 590w,\n/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/a8a14/puzzle.jpg 885w,\n/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/fbd2c/puzzle.jpg 1180w,\n/static/6b9378be89297e79665279c9328bbdcf/ae6d4/puzzle.jpg 5988w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p><sub><sup>Sometimes you have to solve a puzzle.

The latter two were bootstrapped with <code class=\"language-text\">Create React App</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Create React Native App</code>, so we are using established best dev environments.\nRight now, we can render reusable components from the <code class=\"language-text\">universal-components</code> package, to both our targets, mobile and web.</p>\n<h3>Interesting points</h3>\n<p>Especially rendering to mobile, with the help of <a href=\"https://expo.io/\">Expo</a> and without any traditional native setup is awesome. No Android Studio or XCode is required.</p>\n<p>A trip wire in this setup is reusing existing 3rd party React Native components. These are often not transpiled, so we need to do that ourselves for the web env. For that, I patched them using <a href=\"https://github.com/ds300/patch-package\">patch-package</a>, which allows to ‘fix’ npm dependencies reliable in our <code class=\"language-text\">node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, the project is open sourced an on GitHub, so <a href=\"https://github.com/kriswep/universal-react\">see for yourself</a>!
