I'm married and have three children.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I started my professional career in software development after finishing\r\n      my Computer Science studies at the University of Mannheim, Germany. My\r\n      first job was in 2010 as a trainee at IMMOLOGIS GmbH, a software\r\n      consultancy specializing in large-sized real estate companies using SAP\r\n      software. Later I was hired as a full-time software developer at that same\r\n      company. In late 2011 we were bought by one of our competitors, Promos\r\n      consult GmbH &amp; Co. KG, where I'm still employed. Today, I focus on\r\n      some of our products improving the rental process of our customers and\r\n      enabling them to work mobile.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Besides my full-time job, where I mostly work with SAP backend\r\n      technologies, I like tinkering with modern frontend technologies.\r\n      Currently, I enjoy the React and GraphQL stack the most and have some\r\n      spare time projects using these technologies, which can be found on{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://github.com/kriswep\">Github</Link>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h2>Portfolio</h2>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Here's some of the work I've done in recent years. All of them are my\r\n      spare time projects since these are the ones I can talk about freely. I\r\n      also have some smaller projects and tutorials, which can be found either\r\n      here on my blog or on{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://github.com/kriswep\">Github</Link>.\r\n      <br />\r\n      Of course, I also worked on a lot of different projects and products at my\r\n      full-time job, please send me an inquiry per{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"mailto:kriswep@wetainment.com\">mail</Link> if you want to\r\n      learn more about these for some reason.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <h3>AndTeam - Estimations (2019)</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <span>URL:</span>{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://estimation.andteam.app\">estimation.andteam.app</Link>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <span>Code:</span>{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://github.com/kriswep/tpp\">GitHub</Link>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <PortfolioImage\r\n      src=\"/estimation.gif\"\r\n      alt=\"Screenflow of the estimation process\"\r\n    />\r\n    <p>\r\n      AndTeam - Estimations allows teams to connect together and estimate their\r\n      tasks more reliable. It is inspired by the planning poker concepts in\r\n      agile software development. Every team member should connect to the same\r\n      session, and give their estimation to each task represented by story\r\n      points. After everybody picked their estimated number, the cards are\r\n      revealed and the outliers should be discussed. This is repeated until a\r\n      consensus is reached. AndTeam - Estimations gives a nice animated frontend\r\n      to these sessions, and allows product owners to moderate and steer the\r\n      estimation session.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <Technologies>\r\n      <strong>Used technologies:</strong> React for the frontend, WebRTC and\r\n      WebSockets for communication between the clients.\r\n    </Technologies>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Balloon Game (2012)</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <span>URL:</span>{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://play.wetainment.com/balloon\">\r\n        play.wetainment.com/balloon\r\n      </Link>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <span>Code:</span>{' '}\r\n      <Link href=\"https://github.com/kriswep/balloon/\">GitHub</Link>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <PortfolioImage src=\"/balloon.gif\" alt=\"A round of playing balloon\" />\r\n    <p>\r\n      Balloon is an HTML5 Canvas-based game played in the browser. It is best\r\n      played on mobile devices. The main part was developed during the holidays\r\n      in 2012, the game was later refined to use service workers for full\r\n      offline support and sound was added.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      The gameplay was inspired by fruit ninja. The player has to catch balloons\r\n      as they fly towards the sky by touching them. The target audience is\r\n      preschool children. My children still enjoy to play balloon from time to\r\n      time, so it was well worth creating it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <Technologies>\r\n      <strong>Used technologies:</strong> Frameworkless frontend, rendered in\r\n      HTML5-Canvas. Hand-drawn graphics. Web audio is used for generating sound\r\n      effects during runtime. The game can be played offline thanks to the usage\r\n      of service workers.\r\n    </Technologies>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Socsur - German (2008)</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <span>URL:</span> <Link href=\"http://www.socsur.de\">www.socsur.de</Link>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <PortfolioImage src=\"/socsur.png\" alt=\"A poll result chart\" />\r\n    <p>\r\n      Socsur is a platform for creating and sharing simple one question polls.\r\n      It is my first fullscale web project written during my time at university.\r\n      Socsur uses a custom made PHP based backend and templating engine for\r\n      rendering the frontend.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      It was possible to register a user, but not necessary.
